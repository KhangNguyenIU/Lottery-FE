Every day will open a lottery lasting for 12 hours, players will be able to buy a limit of 100 tickets once, with no limit on purchases. Each ticket costs 5$ equivalent to CAKE token. Buying tickets in larger quantities will be discounted with corresponding discounts. When paying, users will be able to choose a 6-digit sequence or randomize. The money players buy tickets will pour into the prizing pool â€“ the total prize of a lottery.

### b. Price distribution
The bonus will be calculated when the sequence of numbers matches the winning sequence starting from the first digit on the left to the right.

Reward structure: (percentage based on prizzing pool)
- 1 digit: 2%
- 2 digits: 3%
- 3 digits: 5%
